      OpenCV can be a bit complicated to use. This little app aims to:
        <ol/>
          <li>
            Let you select one or more images to experiment on. Since this is intended
            to be run locally in your own python environment, I'm not concerned about
            the safety of mine ;).
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a call block. Call blocks act as a tree: top being the
            original image(s). Add and remove call blocks as needed. Blocks
            show thumbnails, click the thumbnail to show the original image.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most blocks have a single input and single output. Some can have
            multiple inputs and/or outputs. That's the main reason this is a
            map instead of a series. Organization is totes up to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many blocks will take any type of image matrix and operate on it.
            But some will only work on grayscale. Some on color, etc. If a block
            works on grayscale and you pass it a color image, it will auto-convert
            from color to grayscale. But using default values, which might not
            be what you want. Ditto for grayscale to color, or anything involving
            HSV, BGR. We use BGR here as that seems to be the most common for
            opencv. But if popular demand requests RGB, I'll try adding support
            for multiple types.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create your own python call blocks! This lets you experiment with
           things we can't easily do in a flexible call block. For example:
           Find a pair of arucos and draw a line between them? Find a QR code
           and write its contents on the image? Make your own call blocks!
          </li>
          <li>
            Call blocks you create can easily use the calls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Replace images as necessary. Copy call block trees. Archive and
            reload them.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

        highlighting for our python code examples.
